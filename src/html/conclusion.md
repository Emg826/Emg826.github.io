## Just One More Thing: the Survey

Now that you've seen and interacted with all of the calculators,
we ask that you follow the link below to fill out the anonymous, Google Forms survey
about your experience. As we mentioned at the start, we did not collect
data about your interactions with the calculators, so this survey is how we intend to
get all of our data. The survey questions are all "rate this on a
scale from 1 to 10" type questions that you can answer via some radio buttons, so it
shouldn't take too long at all. Thanks again.

Oh, by the way, if you click "See previous responses"
on the survey's "thank you" message screen, then you should be able to see the survey results so far
in the form of some bar graphs.
