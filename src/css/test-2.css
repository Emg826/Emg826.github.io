/* One way cascading style sheets (CSS) can be applied to HTML is by
assigning classes to HTML elements [e.g., <input class="classNameHere">].
It's essentially an object oriented approach. This is the approach I'm taking
for the calculator. I already assigned classes to the relevant HTML elements,
so all that we have to do is edit the style sets for those classes, which are
below. The "." indicates that this style set is for a class, and the
word(s) to the right of the "." is the actual class name assigned in the
HTML of the webpage. I tried to make the class names as clear a possible
so that we don't have to look at the HTML at all, so the class names should
tell you what you're styling on the HTML/JavaScript calculator.

Note: there is a hierarchy of sorts since there can be multiple classes per
element. The most specific class will take precedence over all prior classes.
For instance, .one > .number > .key, at least I think.


Note: I commented out a lot of other options that are available. This is
intentional. It's just good to be aware of all our options. */
