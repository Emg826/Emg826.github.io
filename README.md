This repository hosts a Github pages website that was used in a user interface design experiment. The experiment tests for the "aesthetic usability effect," which states that there is a moderately strong, positive correlation between the beauty of an interface and its perceived usability, by holding constant "actual usability." Our experiment has participants use 12 different looking though functionally equivalent scientific calculators. Participants take a pre and post experiment survey to record their opinions on these calculators. The results of our experiment and survey indicate that there is a very strong, positive correlation: one that is greater than 0.80.
