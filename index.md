## Welcome
Thank you for your interest in participating in our experiment on user interface design. In this experiment, you will be asked to complete one or two tasks on a series of different scientific calculators. We will *not* be collecting data over the course of this experiment. Instead, we ask that you fill out the pre-experiment and post-experiment Google Forms surveys. Both surveys are anonymous, and each should only take 2 to 4 minutes. You can click the green button below to get started with the pre-experiment survey. From there, just follow provided arrows and/or links.

**You hereby consent to and begin the experiment by clicking "I agree to participate. Let's begin!"**
