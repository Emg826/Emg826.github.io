## Welcome
*Note: if you only have time to complete the 2-4 minute pre-experiment survey, then please do so (by clicking the green button at the bottom of the page). That would still be helpful.*


Thank you for your interest in participating in our experiment on user interface design. In this experiment, you will be asked to complete one or two tasks on a series of different scientific calculators. We will *not* be collecting data over the course of this experiment. Instead, we ask that you fill out the pre-experiment and post-experiment Google Forms surveys. Both surveys are anonymous, and each should only take 2 to 4 minutes. You can click the green button below to get started with the pre-experiment survey. From there on out, just follow the provided arrows and/or links. The whole process should take approximately 18 to 20 minutes.


**You hereby consent to and begin the experiment by clicking "I agree to participate. Let's begin!"**
