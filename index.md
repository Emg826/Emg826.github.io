## Welcome
Thank you for your interest in participating in our experiment on user interface design. In this experiment, you will be asked to complete one or two tasks on a series of different scientific calculators. Each scientific calculator will have a unique design, and each task will be unique to that calculator. We will *not* be collecting data over the course of this experiment, so we ask that you click on the Google Forms link to fill out an anonymous survey about your experience. The link will appear upon completion of the final task.

**You consent to and begin the experiment by clicking "I agree to participate. Let's begin!"**
